# THE TCP/IP PROTOCOL SUITE

The protocol stack used on the Internet is the Internet Protocol Suite. It is usually called TCP/IP after two of its most prominent protocols, but there are other protocols as well.


The TCP/IP model is based on a five-layer model for networking.
From bottom (the link) to top (the user application), these are the physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers.

## THE TCP/IP LAYERS

The TCP/IP protocol stack models a series of protocol layers for networks and systems that allows communications between any types of devices. The model consists of five separate but related layers, as shown in Figure below.

 The Internet protocol suite is based on these five layers. TCP/IP says most about the network and transport layers, and a lot about the application layer. TCP/IP also defines how to interface the network layer with the data link and physical layers, but is not directly concerned with these two layers themselves.
